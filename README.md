## Hi 👋

I'm Emi, an advanced Computer Science student from Argentina.

I build backend systems focused on clean architecture, clear logic, and maintainable structure.
I'm interested in how software works under the hood and how to design it properly.

I care about solid abstractions, simplicity, and writing code that makes sense.

A few things about me:

- I think in terms of systems and architecture
- I value clarity over unnecessary complexity
- I enjoy designing and refining backend logic
- I continuously improve what I build
